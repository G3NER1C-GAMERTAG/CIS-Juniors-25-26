        <h2>What is Halo: Reach?</h2>
            <p>Halo: Reach is a first-person shooter set on the fictional planet of Reach in late 2552<br>
        
                <h2>What is the game about?</h2>
            <p>The game is set on Reach, a very important colony in the UNSC, where the Spartans come from. The game has one playable protagonist.</h2>
            <h2>Noble Six</h2>
            <p>Noble Six is a Spartan III is the newest member of Noble Team, a task force consisting of Spartan supersoldiers defending Reach. What's special about Noble Six is that the player can create the character. The armor designs, colors, emblems, prosthesis, even gender are determined by the player. Six is the only other spartan than Hamster Chief to be described as, "Hyper-lethal." Their case files are classified almost entirely, and very little is known about them.</p>
