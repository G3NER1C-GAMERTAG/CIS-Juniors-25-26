        <h1>HALO: REACH</h1>
        <h2>What is Halo: Reach?</h2>
            <p>Detroit: Become Human is an interactive science fiction drama game developed by Quantic Dream and pubslished by Sony Interactive Entertainment.<br>
            The game is roughly 8-10 hours long, features replayable missions, is rated M for Mature, and released for PlayStation 4 in 2018, Windows in 2019, and Epic Games in 2020.<br>
        <h2>What is the game about?</h2>
            <p>The game is set in the titular Detroit, Michigan in late 2038. Androids developed by CyberLife have taken over most of the human workforce. When certain Androids become sentient, the fate of the world is left at stake. The game features three playable protagonists.</p>
        <h2>Connor</h2>
            <p>Connor, portrayed by Bryan Dechart, is an RK800 Android. He is a prototype. He was sent to the Detroit Police Force to actively hunt and capture Deviant Androids. Early on in the case, he is assigned to work with Lieutenant Hank Anderson, portrayed by Clancy Brown. Hank was once an aspiring and exceptional officer until he lost his son in a devastating accident. Hank sunk into alcoholism and a pessimistic and nihilistic attitude. Throughout the game, Connor, through the player's decisions, can either restore Hank's resolve or make it far, far worse.</p>
        <h2>Kara</h2>
            <p>Kara, portrayed by Valorie Curry, is an AX400 Android. She is a very popular housekeeping Android, due to her friendly programmed nature, and her ability to get along with children. The Kara we follow becomes a Deviant. She helps a young child, Alice, portrayed by Audrey Boustani, escape her terrible home life and they go on the run. Kara can either become a perfect mother figure to Alice, or a neglectful and hopeless guardian.</p>
        <h2>Markus</h2>
            <p>Markus, portrayed by Jesse Williams, is an RK200 Android. He is a prototype. He was gifted by former CyberLife CEO and founder Elijah Kamski to Carl Manfred, an elderly painter who is paralyzed from the waist down. Carl and Markus developed a father-son relationship, which irked Carl's actual son, Leo. After a tense confrontation, Markus is left for dead in a junkyard. He literally pieces himself back together and becomes the leader of the Android revolution. Markus can either be a pacifist leader, or a ruthless and violent killer for his people.</p>
        <h2>Gameplay<h2>
            <p>Detroit: Become Human is not a shooter, or a beat 'em up, or hack and slash. Instead, it is an interactive experience where things like actions, dialogue and outcomes are determined entirely by the player's decision. At any point during the story, the protagonists can die. Unlike most games, when they die, there is no "Game Over" screen. Instead, the game simply continues without them. Even the smallest things can come back to show the effect you had on it. Your relationships, roles, duties, they are all susceptible to your whims. There are numerous endings to the game, including happy endings, tragic endings, and everything inbetween. It's all up to you.</p>
        <h2>Where did it come from?</h2>
            <p>Detroit: Become Human is my favorite for many reasons: An engaging and everchanging story, complex characters, great music. But why did I want to play it? Let me answer that hypothetical question.<br>
                In August 2021, when I was twelve years old, I was checking out the PS Plus (formerly PlayStation Now) library and I found Detroit: Become Human. Where the actual interest came from was when I saw a meme based on the infamous "28 STAB WOUNDS!" line from the Connor mission, "The Interrogation," where after solving a murder, the suspect, an Android, is being questioned. I wanted to see that for myself. So I played for a couple hours and was satisfied. Until I forgot about it.<br>
                Then, in early 2022, I played the demo and my interest came back. When I turned 13, I used my birthday money to buy a PS4 copy of the game. 8 days later, it arrived and I finished my first playthrough. Everybody died, lol.</p>
        <h2>Why some people would disagree.</h2>
            <p>As peak as Detroit: Become Human is, some people would have problems with some of its content. To be fair, the game has MANY uses of vulger languange, it's pretty violent, and it has unsettling things like a cults.</p>
